The Oceans 2.0.3.0 Data Management and Archival System
â†’ Oceans 3.0 rests upon ten foundational pillars: (1) A robust and stable system architecture to serve as the backbone within a context of constant technological progress and evolving needs of the operators and end users; (2) a data acquisition and archival framework for infrastructure management and data recording, including instrument drivers and parsers to capture all data and observatory actions, alongside task management options and support for data versioning; (3) a metadata system tracking all the details necessary to archive Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproducible (FAIR) data from all scientific and non-scientific sensors; (4) a data Quality Assurance and Quality Control lifecycle with a consistent workflow and automated testing to detect instrument, data and network issues; (5) a data product pipeline ensuring the data are served in a wide variety of standard formats; (6) data discovery and access tools, both generalized and use-specific, allowing users to find and access data of interest; (7) an Application Programming Interface that enables scripted data discovery and access; (8) capabilities for customized and interactive data handling such as annotating videos or ingesting individual campaign-based data sets; (9) a system for generating persistent data identifiers and data citations, which supports interoperability with external data repositories; (10) capabilities to automatically detect and react to emergent events such as earthquakes.
